When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To have a remote copy I can access anywhere. Possibly like a backup. It makes it easier to share my code with other people as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
